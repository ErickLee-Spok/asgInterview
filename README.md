Reference the screen shot 'Screen Shot 2023-02-07 at 6.19.53 PM.png'

- Render each property from a person on the screen as seen in the screen shot. 
- Put first name and last name in different divs, but render them in one line, using flex, as seen in the screenshot
- Add an input to each person's section. 
	- Store each character in state
	- Console log each character typed 
	- When you type in more than 5 characters, it will create an alert with a message.
